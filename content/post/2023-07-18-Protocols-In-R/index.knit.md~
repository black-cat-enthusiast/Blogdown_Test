# Background

- Western blotting allows for rapid semi-quantitative analysis of relative levels of a protein (s) of interest in a set of samples. 
- Adaptation of the theory used to "blot" RNA (Northern Blotting) and DNA (southern blotting) for protein. 
- Samples are pulled through a gel via electrophoresis to sort them by size. 
- Separated proteins are transferred onto a peice of "membrane" paper, where antibody-based detection can be used to probe protein concentrations. 

# Tissue Collection

Western blotting can be used for protein detection in a variety of sample types (e.g. blood), but typically brain tissue is used in neuroscience applications. Fresh brain tissue should be snap-frozen either via isopentane on dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Perfused brain tissue cannot be used for western blotting because perfusion 'fixes' proteins in their [quatrinary formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_quaternary_structure), meaning that they cannot be denatured.

- Prepare 1in*1in pieces of tin foil with animal IDs written on both sides in sharpie for tissue collection. 
- Chill ~50 ml of isopentane on dry ice for >10 mins before beginning. 
- Fill the isopentane beaker right up to the top to avoid fresh tissue touching cold glass. If brains touch the frozen walls of the beaker they will stick.
- Store snap-frozen brains wrapped in tin foils at -80 until the time of sample processing. 
- Isopentane can be stored in the fridge and re-used until it disappears (evaporates at room temperature).

# Dissection 

*The process that you will follow to dissect region(s) of interest will depend on your specific experimental parameters*

- Thaw brains one at a time in a 50ml beaker of aCSF / PBS on ice. 
- At first, brains will float. They will be thawed enough to dissect soon after they sink. 
- Lift brains out carefully with a spoon, and dissect on a glass petrie dish covered with moistened filter paper. 
- Re-freeze samples in individually labelled tubes on dry ice. 
- Store samples in a Styrofoam container filled with dry ice while working and at -80 until the time of tissue processing.

# Tissue Processing 

*Purpose: to break cells open so that all the proteins inside them are "dumped" into a "protein soup"*

-	Must add **inhibitors** to prevent degredation of target proteins by endogenous enzymens in the sample. 
  + Always add [protease inhibitor](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/product/roche/04693159001) to prevent general protein degredation. 
  + Add [phosphotase inhibitor](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/product/roche/phossro?gclid=CjwKCAjwge2iBhBBEiwAfXDBR9vTNHUQ_HwzxqfByrqoqjlv4HrcnrupWq7N-Iia4J5mbvGefaBMOxoC1fsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) if targeting phosphorylated proteins. 

**Basic tissue processing for whole-cell lysates:**

- To Lyse cells, use some combination of salt and soap. Soap will deteriorate the fatty cell membranes (just like it erodes grease in your sink!). 
- [Pre-purchased RIPA](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/product/mm/20188) buffer is a great lysis buffer option. Only make your own solutions if you need to for some experiment-specific reason. 
- Dilute RIPA to working concentration before use (stock is 10x - combine 1ml STOCK + 9ml RO).
  + Add inhibitor tablet(s)! **Very important, don't forget!**
- Add *"an appropriate volume"* of 1x RIPA buffer (with dissolved inhibitors) to your samples. 
  + the goal is to create a protein soup that falls in the "goldilocks" (detectable) range - not too concentrated but also not too dilute. 
  + smaller pieces of tissue should be processed with less lysis buffer. 
  + JB + AML 2022/2023 ~150ul works perfect for bilateral ACC samples. 
- Homogenize samples with the automatic tool or by hand with a pipette. 
  + Goal is to create a relatively homogeneous looking greyish / yellowish mixture. 
- Centrifuge samples for 20 minutes at MAX (17500 x G). 
- Collect back 5/6ths of the initial volume of RIPA buffer added, leaving behind the pellet that formed after centrifugation. 
  + This optional step removes chromatin and other long stringy non-homogenized junk from the samples.
  + Removing chromatin improves the end result of the Westerns. 
  
*Use a more refined tissue processing protocol to separate out sub-cellular compartments*
  
# Bradford Assay

*Purpose: To measure protein concentrations in each sample*

### Procedure

#### Prepare Standard Curve: 

- Label a set of tubes A:E
- Add 500 ul RO to each
- Thaw an aliquot of 1 mg/ml BSA (-20 freezer, bottom shelf, left side)
- Add 500 ul STOCK BSA to tube A
- Serial dilute down the line by half:
