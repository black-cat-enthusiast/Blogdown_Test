# Basic R syntax 

**Do This** (**to that**, *with some stipulations*)

- Coding skills come from the ability to navigate and solve novel problems. 
- Google is your best friend when working towards solving R issues.
- Getting good at googling is a skill in and of itself.
- The more specific you can be (e.g. specify "R", the package you are using or the specific command.)

# Some Cheat Sheets 

- Navigating the integrated development environment [aka the IDE](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/Oct2017-ILRI-Workshop/Cheat_Sheets/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)

- General functions in [base R](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

- Data wrangling with [dplyr](https://nyu-cdsc.github.io/learningr/assets/data-transformation.pdf)

- Writing dynamic documents with [Rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)


# Utility of Cheat Sheets
- Broaden your knowledge / generate new ideas (Once you have a base knowledge that you can build on)
    + Cheat sheets are difficult to understand and frustrating to navigate for novice R users.
- Find search terms to solve specific problems.
