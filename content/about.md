This is a navigational base for [Purple Monkey Dishwasher content]() related to data vizualization and analysis using reproduceable (code-based) approaches in R. The codes for each of the pages can be found on [Github](https://github.com/black-cat-enthusiast/Blogdown_Test/tree/master/content/post). Content and website prepared for the lovely graduate students of the Martin Pain Lab by Jennet Baumbach.
