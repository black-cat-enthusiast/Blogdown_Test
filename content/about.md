This is a navigational base for content related to data vizualization and analysis using reproduceable (code-based) approaches in R. 

The codes to reproduce each of the pages are publically available on [Github](https://github.com/black-cat-enthusiast/Blogdown_Test/tree/master/content/post). 

Content and website prepared for the lovely graduate students of the Martin Pain Lab by Jennet Baumbach.
