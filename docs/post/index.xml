      <description>Subsetting Data in R Subsequent data processing setps (statistical analysis, graph generation) works best if you select the data that you are interested in.
Splitting up large data sets into multiple subsetted dataframes has many functions in R programming and is a useful tactic to maintain readable code blocks.

      <description>The General Linear Model The GLM is a family of analytic approaches that involves fitting lines to data points.
The underlying formula for the GLM: $$ \dfrac{signal}{noise} $$
OR, in other words,
$$ \dfrac{systematic\ variance}{error\ variance} $$
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) Like t-tests, ANOVA requires categorical IV(s) and a continuous DV
ANOVA can handle any number of groups and any number of factors. This is the main advantage of ANOVA over t-tests, which can only handle 2 groups and a single factor Dimensions of the ANOVA: The number of factors: &amp;ldquo;One-Way ANOVA&amp;rdquo; = 1 factor &amp;ldquo;Two-way ANOVA&amp;rdquo; = 2 factors The experimental design: repeated measures = Multiple measurements involving the same individuals.</description>

      <description>The General Linear Model The GLM is a family of analytic approaches that involves fitting lines to data points.
The underlying formula for the GLM: $$ \dfrac{signal}{noise} $$ Or, in other words,
$$ \dfrac{systematic\ variance}{error\ variance} $$
The &amp;ldquo;statistic&amp;rdquo; that you see reported represents this ratio. e.g. t (15) = 4.51, p = 0.02 4.51x more systematic variance than error variance 2% chance that these sets of scores belong to a common parent distribution GLM can be broadly divided into 3 families of analyses: 1.</description>

      <description>Example Data There are many available open-source datasets that can be used to explore the unlimited functionality of data analysis in R.
I will use data from my MA thesis to explore basic graphing and data analysis in R.
These data are also Published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Methods On each of the 4 days of testing, rats completed a 1hr long open field test (run around empty box - 64cm * 64cm).</description>

      <description>Utility of functions in R Any process that you find you want to carry out repeatedly can be made into a function In fact, you should make repetitive processes into functions DRY vs WET Code Both acronyms
DRY - &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself&amp;rdquo;
DRY (“Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself”) principle follows the idea of every logic duplication being eliminated by abstraction. This means that during the development process we should avoid writing repetitive duplicated code as much as possible.</description>

      <description>Background Western blotting allows for rapid semi-quantitative analysis of relative levels of a protein(s) of interest in a set of samples. Adaptation of the theory used to &amp;ldquo;blot&amp;rdquo; RNA (Northern Blotting) and DNA (southern blotting) for protein. &amp;ldquo;Protein soup&amp;rdquo; from saples containing unknown concentrations of the proteins of interest are pulled through a gel via electrophoresis to sort them by size. Separated proteins are transferred onto a peice of &amp;ldquo;membrane&amp;rdquo; paper, where antibody-based detection can be used to probe protein concentrations.</description>

      <description>Basic R syntax Do This (to that, with some stipulations)
Developing proficiency in R Learning to read &amp;amp; write code really is like learning a language. Coding skills come from the ability to navigate and solve novel problems. Google is your best friend when working towards solving R issues. Getting good at googling is a skill in and of itself. The more specific you can be with the search terms, the better your chances of finding relevant search results (e.</description>

      <description>Why use ggplot2? There are several ways to create graphical visualizations in R, but ggplot is by far the most comprehensive and well-documented.
ggplot2 allows for control of every element of the chart. any graph that you can imagine, you can make! library(tidyverse) # The tidyverse contains ggplot2.library(reshape2) # for the melt function.data &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;EB_Rats_Nicotine_Sensitization.csv&amp;quot;) # get datadata$PREhorm = factor(data$PREhorm, levels=c(0,1),labels=c(&amp;quot;OIL&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;EB&amp;quot;))data$CHALhorm = factor(data$CHALhorm,levels=c(0,1),labels=c(&amp;quot;OIL&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;EB&amp;quot;))Take a look at the top 6 rows of data:</description>

      <description>Why use reproduceable approaches to data analysis? Word of mouth transmission of information will always lead to inaccuracies:
Advantages to code-based (reproduceable) approaches to data analysis and visualization: 1. Maintain consistency between presentation formats by using continuous file structures.
e.g. lab reports, committee reports, slideshow presentations, conference posters. 2. Maintain consistency between multiple similar graphs.
e.g. match all the axes across a multi-panel figure. 3. Ease of sharing methods and results.</description>
